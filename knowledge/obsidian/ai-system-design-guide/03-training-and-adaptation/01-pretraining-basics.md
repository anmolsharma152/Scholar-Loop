# Pretraining Basics

Pretraining is the most computationally expensive phase of building an LLM, where a model learns general knowledge and language patterns from massive datasets.

## The Pretraining Objective

Most modern LLMs are **Decoder-only** and use **Causal Language Modeling (CLM)**:

```python
# Objective: Minimize Cross-Entropy Loss
Loss = -sum(log P(token_i | token_1, ..., token_{i-1}))
```

The model predicts the next token given the context. This simple objective, at scale, leads to emergent reasoning capabilities.

## Data Curriculum and Quality

In 2025, the focus has shifted from "More Data" to "Better Curriculum."

### The 100T Token Horizon
Frontier models (Llama 4, GPT-5.2) are trained on 15T to 100T tokens. At this scale, **Deduplication** and **Quality Filtering** are the primary differentiators.

### Data Mixture (Dec 2025 Standard)
| Component | Percentage | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Web (CommonCrawl) | 50-60% | General knowledge, diverse styles |
| Code (Github, StackOverflow)| 15-20% | **Critical for Logic & Reasoning** |
| Books (Project Gutenberg) | 10% | Narrative coherence, long context |
| Academic (ArXiv, PubMed) | 10% | Specialized technical knowledge |
| Synthetic (Model-generated) | 5-10% | Math, Logic, and specific instruction paths |

**Nuance: The "Code Effect":**
Research shows that increasing code in the pretraining mix improves a model's performance on **non-coding** reasoning tasks (e.g., math, logic puzzles) by teaching structured thinking.

## Scaling Laws: Training vs. Inference Optimal

### The Chinchilla Paradigm (2022-2024)
`Data Tokens (D) ≈ 20 * Parameters (N)`
For a 70B model, this suggests ~1.4T tokens.

### The Inference-Optimal Paradigm (Dec 2025)
Modern models (Llama 3, Llama 4) are **heavily overtrained** relative to Chinchilla.
- **Why?**: Training cost is paid once; inference cost is paid billions of times.
- **Result**: Small models (8B) are now trained on 15T+ tokens, making them as capable as older 70B models but much cheaper to serve.

| Strategy | Token/Param Ratio | Best For |
|----------|-------------------|----------|
| Chinchilla | 20:1 | Research / Proof of Concept |
| **Inference-Optimal** | **200:1 to 500:1**| Production deployment |

## Training Stability (Dec 2025 Nuances)

Training at the "Ultra" scale (100k+ GPUs) faces massive stability issues.

### 1. Loss Spikes
Sudden jumps in loss that can ruin a training run.
- **2025 Fix**: **Periodic Checkpointing** and **Automatic Rollbacks**.
- **Architecture Fix**: **Residual Scaling** (initializing weights such that the residual branch starts at near-zero).

### 2. Precision: FP8 vs BF16
- **BF16**: The 2023-2024 standard for stability.
- **FP8**: The **2025 Production Standard**. Supported natively by H100/B200, it halves memory usage and doubles throughput while maintaining training stability through **Stochastic Rounding**.

## Interview Questions

### Q: Why train an 8B model on 15T tokens if Chinchilla says 160B tokens is optimal?

**Strong answer:**
Chinchilla optimality focuses on the best use of a fixed **training** compute budget. However, in production, we care about the **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**, which is dominated by inference. By overtraining a small model, we "bake in" more intelligence into fewer parameters. This results in a model that is significantly more efficient to serve (higher TPS, lower VRAM) while maintaining frontier-level quality.

### Q: What is the "curriculum" in LLM pretraining?

**Strong answer:**
Curriculum refers to the order and mixture of data. A common 2025 pattern is:
1. **General Knowledge Phase:** 80% of tokens (Web, Books).
2. **Reasoning Focus Phase:** 15% tokens (Code, Math, Logic).
3. **High-Quality "Cooling" Phase:** The last 1-5% of tokens are extremely high-quality, human-curated, or textbook data. This "cooling" phase helps the model jitter less and follow instructions better before any fine-tuning starts.
