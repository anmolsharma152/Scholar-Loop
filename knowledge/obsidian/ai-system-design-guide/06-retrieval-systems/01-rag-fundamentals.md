# RAG Fundamentals (Dec 2025)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the architectural pattern of providing an LLM with external, verifiable context to ground its responses. In late 2025, RAG has evolved from "simple vector search" to a complex, multi-stage reasoning pipeline.

## The Core Philosophy: Grounding vs. Training

| Aspect | Fine-Tuning | RAG |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| **Knowledge Type** | Internalized (Weights) | externalized (Context) |
| **Update Cycle** | High Cost (Retraining) | Zero Cost (Update DB) |
| **Attribution** | None (Black box) | Explicit (Citations) |
| **Privacy** | Hard to "Unlearn" | Easy to filter/delete |

**2025 Insight**: Fine-tuning is for **Form** (style, tone, syntax); RAG is for **Fact** (knowledge, data, grounding).

## The 2025 RAG Taxonomy

Production RAG systems are now categorized by their "Agentic Depth":

### 1. Naive RAG (Retrieve-then-Generate)
- **Flow**: User Query -> Vector Search -> Top-K -> LLM.
- **2025 Status**: Deprecated for production due to "Retrieval Gap" and low precision.

### 2. Advanced RAG (Multi-Stage)
- **Flow**: Query Transformation -> Hybrid Search -> Reranking -> LLM.
- **Key Nuance**: Uses **RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion)** to combine keyword and semantic results.

### 3. Agentic RAG (Loop-based)
- **Flow**: Agent analyzes query -> Decides which tools/indices to search -> Evaluates results -> Re-retrieves if info is missing.
- **Techniques**: Self-RAG, Corrective RAG (CRAG).

### 4. GraphRAG (Structured context)
- **Flow**: Extract entities/relationships -> Build Knowledge Graph -> Traverse graph to find "connected knowledge."
- **Win**: Solves "Aggregative Questions" (e.g., "Summarize all legal risks across 50 documents").

## RAG vs. 2M Context (The "Hybrid Era")

With context windows like Gemini 1.5 Pro (2M+) and Claude Sonnet 4.5 (1M+), RAG is changing.

- **In-Context RAG (ICR)**: For datasets < 50k tokens, we skip the vector DB and put EVERYTHING in the prompt.
- **Prompt Caching**: Makes Long-Context RAG 90% cheaper by caching the "Background Knowledge" on the GPU.

**Architectural Decision**: 
- If your corpus is > 100k tokens and dynamic: Use **Standard RAG**.
- If your corpus is < 100k tokens: Use **In-Context RAG**.

## The Retrieval Quality Gap

The "Retrieval Gap" is the #1 cause of RAG failure.
- **Gap 1: Semantic Mismatch**: Query says "fast cars," DB has "Porsche 911." Solved by **Embedding Rerankers**.
- **Gap 2: Missing Context**: Relevant info is in the DB, but the Retriever missed it. Solved by **Hybrid Search**.
- **Gap 3: Lost-in-the-Middle**: info is in the prompt, but LLM misses it. Solved by **Context Compression**.

## Interview Questions

### Q: In late 2025, why would you still use RAG if models have 2-million-token contexts?

**Strong answer:**
Three tiers of reasons:
1. **Cost and Latency**: Even with prompt caching, re-reading 2M tokens for every new user query is significantly more expensive and has higher TTFT (Time to First Token) than retrieving 5 relevant chunks (approx. 2k tokens). 
2. **Freshness**: RAG can access real-time APIs (Stock prices, News) which cannot be statically embedded in a context window.
3. **Scale**: Enterprise datasets (SharePoint, Terabyte logs) exceed even 2M tokens. RAG serves as the "Filter" to find the relevant 0.01% of data that *should* go into that high-value context window.

### Q: What is "Agentic RAG" and how does it differ from "Advanced RAG"?

**Strong answer:**
Advanced RAG is a **deterministic pipeline** (Linear: Rewrite -> Search -> Rerank). Agentic RAG is a **stochastic loop**. In Agentic RAG, the model is given tools to decide *how* to retrieve. For example, if the agent finds that the retrieved documents are irrelevant, it can decide to "Search Google" or "Query the SQL database" instead. It essentially adds a "Reasoning step" before and after retrieval to ensure the context is sufficient to answer the prompt.
