# Prompt Optimization (DSPy)

Prompting is moving from the "Hand-tuning" era to the "Programmatic" era. **DSPy (Declarative Self-improving Language Programs)** is the 2025 industry standard for building robust LLM pipelines where prompts are optimized automatically by algorithms.

## The DSPy Philosophy: Programming vs. Prompting

In traditional prompting, changing a model (e.g., from GPT-4o to Llama-4) requires re-writing all your prompts. 
**DSPy separates Logic from Formatting.**

- **Logic**: Defined by **Modules** (e.g., ChainOfThought, ReAct).
- **Optimization**: The system automatically finds the best prompt and examples for a *specific* model to fulfill that logic.

## Signatures & Modules

Instead of writing a prompt, you define a **Signature**: what the input is and what the output should be.

```python
# DSPy 2025 Pattern
class MultiHopQA(dspy.Signature):
    """Answer questions that require multiple context retrievals."""
    context = dspy.InputField()
    question = dspy.InputField()
    answer = dspy.OutputField(desc="A concise 1-sentence answer")

# Logic is handled by a Module
qa_system = dspy.ChainOfThought(MultiHopQA)
```

## Teleprompters (Optimizers)

Teleprompters are algorithms that iterate on your program to improve accuracy.
1. **BootstrapFewShot**: Automatically finds high-quality examples for your prompt.
2. **MIPROv2 (2025)**: A Bayesian optimizer that tries different instruction phrasings and select the one that maximizes your score.

**Why it matters**: You no longer guess if "Be helpful" or "Think carefully" is better. The optimizer proves it with data.

---

## The "Prompt as Weight" Analogy

In DSPy, your prompt is like a weight in a neural network. You don't "hardcode" weights; you train them.
- If you change your model, you just **Re-compile** (re-train) your program. The optimizer will find new few-shot examples that the new model understands better.

---

## Metric-Driven Optimization

Optimization requires a **Metric** (a function that returns a score).
- **Exact Match**: `prediction.answer == target.answer`
- **LLM-as-Judge**: Use a larger model (GPT-5.2) to grade the output of a smaller model (Llama 8B).

## Interview Questions

### Q: How does DSPy solve the "fragility" of prompt engineering?

**Strong answer:**
DSPy moves the complexity of "formatting" and "grounding" away from the human and into the compiler. When we hand-write prompts, we are effectively "hard-coding" behavior that is specific to one model at one specific time (point-in-time tuning). If that model is updated or swapped, the prompt breaks. DSPy treats the prompt as a learnable parameter. By defining a clear **Signature** and a **Metric**, we allow the system to "search" for the most effective prompt through thousands of simulated iterations, making the final system much more resilient to model changes.

### Q: What is a "Teleprompter" in the context of DSPy?

**Strong answer:**
A Teleprompter is a programmatic optimizer. Its job is to take a DSPy program (which might be a complex chain of modules) and a small set of training examples, and then "compile" them into an optimized version. It does this by generating potential "thinking patterns" and examples, testing them against a metric, and selecting the most effective ones. In short, a Teleprompter is the "Gradient Descent" of the prompt engineering world.
