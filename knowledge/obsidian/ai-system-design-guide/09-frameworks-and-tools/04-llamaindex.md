# LlamaIndex (Dec 2025)

While LangChain focuses on "Orchestration," **LlamaIndex** is the master of **Data-Centric AI**. In late 2025, it has evolved from a RAG library into a framework for **Workflows** and **Agentic Data Manipulation**.

## The Data Framework Philosophy

LlamaIndex is built on the belief that **the data is more important than the model**.
- **The Node**: Every chunk of data is a "Node" with rich metadata (relationships, summaries, and parent-child links).
- **The Retriever**: LlamaIndex provides the most diverse set of retrievers (Summary, Knowledge Graph, Tree, and Keyword).

## LlamaIndex Workflows (Dec 2025 Tech)

In late 2024, LlamaIndex introduced **Workflows**, its answer to LangGraph.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Nodes communicate by emitting `Events`.
- **Concurrency**: Workflows are natively async and handle large-scale parallel data processing better than linear chains.

```python
# Conceptual 2025 Workflow
class RAGWorkflow(Workflow):
    @step
    async def ingest(self, ev: StartEvent) -> RetrievalEvent:
        # Custom logic...
        return RetrievalEvent(results=nodes)
```

---

## Advanced Indexing

1. **Property Graphs**: Linking vector chunks to graph nodes for RAG.
2. **Context-Aware Splitters**: Grouping text by "Meaning" rather than "Token count" (using smaller LLMs to find optimal breakpoints).
3. **Dynamic Pathing**: The retriever decides *which* index to query based on the complexity of the question.

---

## LlamaCloud and Managed Ingestion

For enterprise scale, LlamaIndex focuses on **LlamaCloud**.
- **Managed Ingestion**: Handling PDF parsing, OCR, and Table extraction as a service.
- **Parsing as a Model**: Using Vision-LLMs (like Gemini 3) to "Understand" layouts instead of using rule-based parsers.

---

## Agents as Tools

LlamaIndex treats agents as **high-level retrievers**.
- You can "wrap" a complex LlamaIndex query engine as a tool and give it to a LangGraph agent.
- **Benefit**: The agent gets "Smart Data Access" without needing to know the technical details of the vector DB or Graph schema.

## Interview Questions

### Q: LangChain and LlamaIndex now both have "Graph/Workflow" features. How do you choose?

**Strong answer:**
I choose **LlamaIndex Workflows** for **Data-Intensive** tasks where the main complexity is ingestion, multimodal parsing, and complex retrieval. Its event-driven architecture is more performant for massive parallel data processing. I choose **LangGraph** for **Logic-Intensive** multi-agent systems where the complexity is in the "Reasoning" and "Human-in-the-loop" logic. In many senior architectures, we use **Both**: LlamaIndex for the RAG engine and LangGraph for the overall agentic supervisor.

### Q: What is the "Property Graph" in LlamaIndex and why is it superior to basic Vector RAG?

**Strong answer:**
A Property Graph combines the **Semantic flexibility** of vectors with the **Structural precision** of a database. In basic RAG, you might find a chunk about "Project Alpha," but you don't know who owns it. In a Property Graph, the vector chunk is a node linked to a `User` node and a `Timeline` node. This allows for **Global Reasoning** (e.g., "Find all documents written by Tom in the last month about Project Alpha"). Basic RAG would likely miss many related nodes because they don't contain the exact keyword "Alpha."
