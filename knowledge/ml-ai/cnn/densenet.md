# DenseNet (2017)

![Dense block](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rahul1038402/what_i_know/main/monorepo/dl/cnn/images/dense-block.png)

DenseNet takes ResNet's skip-connection idea further: **concatenate** all previous feature maps instead of adding them.

## Key difference from ResNet

| | ResNet | DenseNet |
|---|--------|----------|
| Skip connection operation | **Addition**: `x + F(x)` | **Concatenation**: `[x₀, x₁, ..., x_{ℓ-1}]` |
| Each layer receives | Output of previous layer + skip from earlier | **All** previous layers' feature maps |

So in DenseNet, layer `ℓ` receives the feature maps of **ALL** preceding layers as input:

```
x_ℓ = H_ℓ([x₀, x₁, ..., x_{ℓ-1}])
```

Where `[...]` denotes concatenation along the channel dimension.

## How dense blocks work

Within a "dense block":

- Layer 1 sees: input `x₀`
- Layer 2 sees: `[x₀, x₁]` (concatenated)
- Layer 3 sees: `[x₀, x₁, x₂]`
- Layer 4 sees: `[x₀, x₁, x₂, x₃]`
- ...

Each layer's output is a small set of new feature maps (called the "growth rate", typically k=12 or k=32). These get concatenated to the running input for the next layer.

## Benefits

**1. Maximum gradient flow.** Every layer has direct access to the loss gradient — there's a path from every layer to the output. This is the strongest possible gradient flow you can get.

**2. Feature reuse.** Earlier features are directly available to later layers. The network doesn't need to "re-learn" early-layer features — it just looks them up.

**3. Parameter efficient.** Each layer can be **thin** (small growth rate) since it builds on all previous features. DenseNet-121 has **far fewer parameters** than ResNet-50 with similar accuracy.

## Why concatenation beats addition

ResNet's addition `x + F(x)` mixes the original signal and the new computation. Information from `x` and `F(x)` interferes with each other.

DenseNet's concatenation **preserves both signals separately**. Layer 5 can see exactly what layer 1 produced, untouched. The network has more flexibility about which features to use at each depth.

## Trade-offs

**Memory cost:** Concatenating features grows the channel dimension fast. A 4-layer dense block with k=32 starts with C₀ channels and ends with C₀ + 4×32 channels. Memory usage during training is significantly higher than ResNet.

This is why DenseNets are often **smaller** in absolute layer count than ResNet equivalents — the channel growth limits how deep you can go.

## Architecture structure

```
Input
  ↓
[Initial Conv]
  ↓
[Dense Block 1]    ← layers concatenate within block
  ↓
[Transition Layer]  ← 1×1 conv + 2×2 pool to reduce channels and spatial size
  ↓
[Dense Block 2]
  ↓
[Transition Layer]
  ↓
[Dense Block 3]
  ↓
...
  ↓
[Global Avg Pool]
  ↓
[FC + Softmax]
```

Transition layers between dense blocks are key — they prevent the channel dimension from growing too large by compressing it back down.

## Variants

- **DenseNet-121** — 121 layers, baseline
- **DenseNet-169, 201, 264** — deeper variants
- **DenseNet-BC** — adds bottleneck (1×1 conv in each layer) and compression (transition reduces channels by half)

## Exam distinction (worth memorizing)

> **ResNet = addition of skip**
> **DenseNet = concatenation of all previous maps**

Different operation, different consequence:
- Addition: same channel count, blends information
- Concatenation: growing channel count, preserves information

## When to use what

- **ResNet** — when you want very deep networks (50-200 layers) with manageable memory
- **DenseNet** — when you want maximum feature reuse and parameter efficiency, can afford the memory cost
- **Modern alternative** — both are largely superseded by transformer-based vision models (ViT, Swin) for state-of-the-art results, but ResNet/DenseNet remain solid baselines.
